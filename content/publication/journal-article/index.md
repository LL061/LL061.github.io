abstract: In this study, we examine the length of IUs in which words appear and position of words within IUs in the Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English (DuBois et al. 2000), which is manually annotated for IUs based on acoustic cues (DuBois 1992). We find strong systematicity in word distributions across the lexicon, modellable with simple probabilistic models.
