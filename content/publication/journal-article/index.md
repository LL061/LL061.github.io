abstract: Emotions are ubiquitous in languages. To investigate the processing advantages of negative and positive words over neutral words in L1 and L2 speakers, this meta-analysis synthesized 87 studies (383 effect sizes). We investigated how processing advantages were moderated by other emotional properties (arousal, emotion word type), linguistic information (concreteness, frequency, word length, orthographic and phonological neighborhood sizes), and task type. Our results showed a small to medium processing advantage for positive words in L1 speakers. Additionally, the processing disadvantage of emotion-label words compared to emotion-laden words was greater for negative words than positive ones in L2 speakers. Furthermore, L2 speakers’ processing of positive words was more sensitive to the inhibitory effects of arousal and length than negative words. Task type was also found to play an important role in L1 speakers’ emotion word processing. Overall, our findings lend support to theoretical frameworks in language acquisition, processing, and cognition.
