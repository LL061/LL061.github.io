Explore the different factors that influence tonal coarticulation in Cantonese

<!--more-->


Coarticulation refers to the phenomenon where segments are affected by and overlap with neighboring segments (Daniloff and Hammarberg 1973). Building on the concept of coarticulation at the segmental level, research has extended to the suprasegmental level of speech, particularly focusing on the coarticulation in the production of tones in tonal languages. The present study investigates the effects of tonal coarticulation on the high level Tone 1 and the low-mid level Tone 6 in Cantonese monosyllabic words, with a focus on the interaction between tonal coarticulation, syllable structure, and lexical frequency. Using a corpus-based approach com- bined with the random forest modeling, we identified the presence of assimilatory carryover and anticipatory effect in spontaneous Cantonese speech.
