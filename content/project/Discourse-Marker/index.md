The canonical and non-canonical use of the similative demonstrative

<!--more-->

Our analysis contains three main non-canonical use of the similative demonstrative. First of all, _gam2_ mitigates an utterance expressing a disaffiliation to interlocutor's stance. In addition, when someone challenges an action you prevously took, _gam2_ projects an insistence on your initial action. Finally, _gam2_ begins various units (intonation units, clauses turn-constructional units) to index progression within a communicative project.

The above data demonstrats a use of insistence, where in line 2 B expresses his interest in watching whales. In Line 6, A challenges B's stances, asserts that whale-watching is boring and potentially dangerous. In Line 7 insist his interest in whale-watching by furnishing argument against the relevance of biting.
